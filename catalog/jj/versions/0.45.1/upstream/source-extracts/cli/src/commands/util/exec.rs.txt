/// Execute an external command via jj
///
/// This command will have access to the environment variable JJ_WORKSPACE_ROOT.
///
/// This is useful for arbitrary aliases.
///
/// !! WARNING !!
///
/// The following technique just provides a convenient syntax for running
/// arbitrary code on your system. Using it irresponsibly may cause damage
/// ranging from breaking the behavior of `jj undo` to wiping your file system.
/// Exercise the same amount of caution while writing these aliases as you would
/// when typing commands into the terminal!
///
/// This feature may be removed or replaced by an embedded scripting language in
/// the future.
///
/// Let's assume you have a script called "my-jj-script" in your $PATH and you
/// would like to execute it as "jj my-script". You would add the following line
/// to your configuration file to achieve that:
///
/// ```toml
/// [aliases]
/// my-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "my-jj-script"]
/// #                            ^^^^
/// # This makes sure that flags are passed to your script instead of parsed by jj.
/// ```
///
/// If you don't want to manage your script as a separate file, you can even
/// inline it into your config file:
///
/// ```toml
/// [aliases]
/// my-inline-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "bash", "-c", """
/// set -euo pipefail
/// echo "Look Ma, everything in one file!"
/// echo "args: $@"
/// """, ""]
/// #    ^^
/// # This last empty string will become "$0" in bash, so your actual arguments
/// # are all included in "$@" and start at "$1" as expected.
/// ```
///
/// > Note: Shebangs (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env`) aren't necessary since you're
/// > already explicitly passing your script into the right shell.
